# DeadMan
DeadMan is an implementation of a [dead man's Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch) to monitor jobs. It's a simple tool that gives visibility  when jobs fail to run.

After a job runs, a heartbeat is sent to DeadMan. If a job is registered to run at a certain interval but doesn't get a heartbeat, it's notification callback will be invoked.

## Install
Put this line in your Gemfile:
    gem 'dead-man', require: 'dead_man'

## Install

## Usage
There are three parts to setting up the Dead Man:
- Registering switches
- Sending heartbeats
- Registering notification callbacks

### Registering Switches
To register a job as a DeadMan switch, simply supply the  unique name of the job along with the frequency at which the job should run:

    DeadMan::Switch.register_switch 'UniqueJobName', 2.hours

### Sending Heartbeats
In your application, send a unique heartbeat to DeadMan for a specified job:

    DeadMan::Heartbeat.pulse('UniqueJobName')

### Registering Callbacks
Now that DeadMan is tracking jobs, the final step is connecting your notification system. Pass a block to register a callback for failure notifications.

    DeadMan::Switch.register_callback -> (message) { SLACK.ping("Failed job: #{message}" }
